# Java Lab Programms

```Navigate to any labs, you can start from bottom to top or otherwise follow the structure ```

This project contains Java programs that correspond to problems and exercises typically found in C programming language practicals. While the problems are originally intended for C, they have been implemented in Java for practice and learning purposes.

## Lab Directories

- [**lab_01**: lab practicals for session one](lab_01)
- [**lab_02**: lab practicals for session two](lab_02)
- [**lab_03**: lab practicals for session three](lab_03)
- [**lab_04**: lab practicals for session four](lab_04)
- [**lab_05**: lab practicals for session five](lab_05)

Each lab directory contains exercises and examples related to the respective session topic.

## Note

While the labs focus on C programming concepts, they are implemented in Java to provide a more accessible learning experience, allowing learners to understand the underlying principles without getting bogged down in language-specific syntax.
