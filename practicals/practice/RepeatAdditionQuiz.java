/*
    This program generates random addition questions and prompts the user to answer them.
    - It generates two random numbers between 0 and 9 and between 0 and 6 for the addition operation.
    - It repeatedly prompts the user for the sum of the two numbers until the correct answer is provided.
    - Once the correct answer is provided, the program displays a success message and terminates.
