// JAVA METHODS II

public class ExtraMethodConcepts {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Call the method to print the welcome message
        printWelcomeMessage();
    }

    // Method that print a welcome message

}

/*
- We defined a class named "Extra".
- Inside the "Main" Class we define the main method which is an entry point of the program
- We call the "PrintWelcomeMessage" method which prints a welcome message to the console.
- The "printWelcomeMessage" method is declared with a return type void, indicating that it doesn't return anything.
- The method doesn't have any parameters.
- Inside the method, we use System.out.println to print the welcome message.

/*
This demonstrates how to define and call a method in Java that doesn't return anything and doesn't have any parameters.
You can use such methods for performing tasks that don't require input parameters or returning values.

// YOU CAN DECLARE A FUNCTION BEFORE CALLING IT OR YOU CAN CALL THE FUNCTION BEFORE DECLARING IT. BOTH WILL WORK
// LOOK AT Main.java FILE TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN Extra.java and Main.java....
