## How to Run

Each Java file is a standalone program and can be run independently. To compile and run a specific file, use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
javac FileName.java
java FileName
```

### Purpose

The purpose of this part is to provide a foundation for understanding basic Java concept of mathematical functions, string manipulations and character manipulations.
