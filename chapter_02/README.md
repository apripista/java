# Chapter 02: Methods in Java

###### Please READ all README files They provide more information about how to use the Project's repository.

Welcome to Chapter II, repository for learning Java programming language. In this repository you will learn more about.
`Methods`.
In Java, a method is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called or invoked from another part of the program. Methods are used to organize code into reusable blocks, improving code readability, modularity, and maintainability. Here are some key points about methods in Java:

## Introduction
###### Why Methods in Java: 
- Modularity: Methods break down a program into smaller, more manageable pieces, enhancing code organization and readability.

- Code Reusability: Methods allow you to reuse code by calling the same method multiple times without duplicating it.

- Abstraction: Methods hide implementation details, focusing on what a piece of code does rather than how it does it, simplifying programming.

- Encapsulation: Methods encapsulate related code together, promoting code organization and protecting data integrity.

- Parameter Passing: Methods can accept parameters, enabling them to perform tasks based on input values, enhancing flexibility and versatility.

- Code Organization: Methods help organize code logically, creating a structured and hierarchical codebase, facilitating navigation and understanding.

In summary, methods play a crucial role in Java programming by promoting modularity, reusability, abstraction, encapsulation, parameter passing, and code organization.
