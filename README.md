# Learn Java Programming 

This repository contains code files and resources for learning Java programming language. The structure of the repository is organized into different sections, each focusing on specific topics.

`Read all readme.md files they provide a meaningful way to understand the structure of the entire directory(repository.)` and `java files are created with .java extension. example: Filename.java, Main.java`

Thanks for understanding.

## Learning Paths

1. **[Chapter 01: Introduction to Java Programming](chapter_01)**
   - **[part one](chapter_01/part_01)**: Introduction to Java programming language.
   - **[part two](chapter_01/part_02)**: Variables, operators, Strings, and mathematical operations.
   - **[part three](chapter_01/part_03)**: Control statements, loops, and arrays.

2. **[Chapter 02: Methods in Java Programming](chapter_02)**

   - Introduction to methods in Java.
   - Explanation of method declaration and invocation.
   - Different types of methods: static methods, instance methods, constructors.
   - Method overloading and overriding.
   - Examples demonstrating the usage of methods in Java programs.

2. **[Chapter 03: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming](chapter_03)**
   - Introduction to Objects and Classes in Java.
   - Introduction to Inheritance and Polymorphism in Java.
   - Exception Handling and Text I/O in Java
   - Abstract Classes and Interfaces in Java
   
## Usage

Feel free to explore the directories and files according to your learning needs. Each section contains code examples and explanations to help you understand different concepts in Java programming.

To run the Java files directly with Java, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
java Filename.java
```

or you may start by compiling the file and then run the compiled  class

```bash
javac Filename.java
```

the command above will create a java class of the respective java file in the same directory and then run this command

```bash
java Filename
```

the java class has a .class extension but this time run it wihout a .class extension.

Replace `Filename.java` with the name of the Java file you want to execute.
