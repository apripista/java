# Fundamentals of Programming

## Chapter V: Loops

This chapter delves into the fundamentals of loops, a core concept in programming that enables the repetition of tasks based on specific conditions. The exercises presented here are designed to solidify your understanding of loops by applying them to various practical scenarios, such as number analysis, unit conversion, and prime number identification. By completing these exercises, you'll gain a strong foundation in implementing loops in Java to address common programming challenges.
