# Part 03 - Java Basics

## Overview

This part of the project contains simple Java programs that introduce basic concepts of Java programming, including arrays, control statements, loops, and the use of break and continue statements.

## Files and Directories

1. **[Main.java](Main.java)**: This file contains the main entry point of the Java application and provides an introduction to the project.

### Arrays Directory
2. **[ArrayCopyExample.java](arrays/ArrayCopyExample.java)**: Demonstrates how to copy elements from one array to another.
3. **[Arrays.java](arrays/Arrays.java)**: Covers basic array operations and manipulations.
4. **[ArrayStrings.java](arrays/ArrayStrings.java)**: Focuses on arrays of strings and operations specific to them.
5. **[CopyArrays.java](arrays/CopyArrays.java)**: Similar to ArrayCopyExample.java, with additional methods or examples.
6. **[MultidimensionalArray.java](arrays/MultidimensionalArray.java)**: Deals with multidimensional arrays and their usage.
7. **[NumberAnalyzer.java](arrays/NumberAnalyzer.java)**: Uses arrays to perform operations like finding the maximum, minimum, or average values.
8. **[UserInput.java](arrays/UserInput.java)**: Shows how to take array input from users and manipulate it.

### Control Statements Directory
9. **[ControlStatementI.java](controlstatements/ControlStatementI.java)**: Covers switch-case, and other basic control statements.
10. **[ControlStatementII.java](controlstatements/ControlStatementII.java)**: Continues from ControlStatementI.java, covering more advanced control statements like if-statememts and else-if statememts.

### Loops Directory
11. **[ForLoop.java](loops/ForLoop.java)**: Contains examples and explanations of for loops.
12. **[WhileLoop.java](loops/WhileLoop.java)**: Contains examples and explanations of while loops.

13. **[BreakContinue.java](BreakContinue.java)**: Demonstrates the use of break and continue statements in loops.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the `part_03` directory.
3. Compile the Java files using the following command:

   ```sh

    javac *.java arrays/*.java controlstatements/*.java loops/*.java

  ```

Run any of the compiled programs using the java command. For example, to run Main.java, use:

```sh

 java Main

```
### Purpose

The purpose of this part is to provide a foundation for understanding basic Java concepts and syntax related to arrays, control statements, loops, and the use of break and continue statements. Each file is designed to be a small, self-contained example that illustrates a specific aspect of the Java language.
