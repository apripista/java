# Part 03 - Java Loops and Control Structures

## Overview

This part of the project focuses on Java loops and control structures. It covers basic and advanced loop concepts, including `for` loops, `while` loops, and the use of `break` and `continue` statements. Additionally, it explores loop design strategies and sentinel-controlled input.

## Files

1. **[For Loop](ForLoop.java)**: Introduces the basic `for` loop structure and usage.
2. **[For Loops Advanced Concepts](ForLoopsAdvancedConcepts.java)**: Delves into advanced concepts related to `for` loops.
3. **[While Loop](WhileLoop.java)**: Covers the basic `while` loop structure and usage.
4. **[While Loop Advanced](WhileLoopAdvanced.java)**: Discusses advanced topics related to `while` loops.
5. **[Break Continue](BreakContinue.java)**: Demonstrates the use of `break` and `continue` statements within loops.
6. **[Sentinel And Input Redirection](SentinelAndInputRedirection.java)**: Explores the use of sentinel values and input redirection in loops.
7. **[Loop Design Strategies](LooopDesignStrategies.java)**: Provides insights into effective loop design strategies.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the `part_02` directory.
3. Compile the Java files using the following command:
   ```sh
   javac *.java

Run any of the compiled programs using the java command. For example, to run Booleans.java, use:
```sh
java Booleans
```
## Purpose
The purpose of this part is to further enhance the understanding of basic Java concepts. Each file is designed to be a small, self-contained example that illustrates a specific aspect of the Java language.
