# Chapter 01 - Java Basics

## Overview

This chapter of the project contains simple Java programs that introduce basic concepts of Java programming. It is divided into three parts, each focusing on different fundamental aspects of the language.

## Parts

### Part 01 - Java Basics

This part of the project covers the following topics:

1. **[Main.java](part_01/Main.java)**: The main entry point of the Java application.
2. **[Naming.java](part_01/Naming.java)**: Illustrates the naming conventions used in Java.
3. **[Numerals.java](part_01/Numerals.java)**: Covers the use of numerals in Java.
4. **[Output.java](part_01/Output.java)**: Shows how to produce output in Java.
5. **[TypeCasting.java](part_01/TypeCasting.java)**: Explains type casting in Java.

### Part 02 - Java Basics Continued

This part continues with more fundamental Java concepts:

1. **[Booleans.java](part_02/Booleans.java)**: Introduces the boolean data type and operations.
2. **[Mathematics.java](part_02/Mathematics.java)**: Covers basic mathematical operations in Java.
3. **[Operators.java](part_02/Operators.java)**: Demonstrates the use of various operators in Java.
4. **[SpecialCharacter.java](part_02/SpecialCharacter.java)**: Discusses special characters and escape sequences in Java.

### Part 03 - Advanced Java Basics

This part delves into more advanced basics, including arrays, control statements, and loops:

#### Arrays Directory

1. **[ArrayCopyExample.java](part_03/arrays/ArrayCopyExample.java)**: Demonstrates how to copy elements from one array to another.
2. **[Arrays.java](part_03/arrays/Arrays.java)**: Covers basic array operations and manipulations.
3. **[ArrayStrings.java](part_03/arrays/ArrayStrings.java)**: Focuses on arrays of strings and operations specific to them.
4. **[CopyArrays.java](part_03/arrays/CopyArrays.java)**: Similar to ArrayCopyExample.java, with additional methods or examples.
5. **[MultdimensionalArray.java](part_03/arrays/MultdimensionalArray.java)**: Deals with multidimensional arrays and their usage.
6. **[NumberAnalyzer.java](part_03/arrays/NumberAnalyzer.java)**: Uses arrays to perform operations like finding the maximum, minimum, or average values.
7. **[UserInput.java](part_03/arrays/UserInput.java)**: Shows how to take array input from users and manipulate it.

#### Control Statements Directory

1. **[ControlStatementI.java](part_03/controlstatements/ControlStatementI.java)**: Covers if-else statements, switch-case, and other basic control statements.
2. **[ControlStatementII.java](part_03/controlstatements/ControlStatementII.java)**: Continues from ControlStatementI.java, covering more advanced control statements.

#### Loops Directory

1. **[ForLoop.java](part_03/loops/ForLoop.java)**: Contains examples and explanations of for loops.
2. **[WhileLoop.java](part_03/loops/WhileLoop.java)**: Contains examples and explanations of while loops.
3. **[BreakContinue.java](part_03/loops/BreakContinue.java)**: Demonstrates the use of break and continue statements in loops.

4. **[Main.java](part_03/Main.java)**: Provides an introduction to Part 03 and directs users to the different sections.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the desired part directory (e.g., `part_01`, `part_02`, or `part_03`).
3. Compile the Java files using the following command:
   ```sh
   javac *.java

   ```

   For Part 03, include subdirectories:


```
    javac *.java arrays/*.java controlstatements/*.java loops/*.java

```

Run any of the compiled programs using the java command. For example, to run Main.java in Part 01, use:
```
java Main

```

### Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a foundation for understanding basic Java concepts and syntax. Each part is designed to be a small, self-contained example that illustrates specific aspects of the Java language.
