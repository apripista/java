# Part 01 - Java Basics

## Overview

This part of the project contains simple Java programs that introduce basic concepts of Java programming, including main methods, naming conventions, numerals, output, and type casting.

## Files

1. [Main.java](Main.java): This file contains the main entry point of the Java application
2. [Naming.java](Naming.java): This file illustrates the naming conventions used in Java
3. [Numerals.java](Numerals.java): This file covers the use of numerals in Java
4. [Output.java](Output.java): This file shows how to produce output in Java
5. [TypeCasting.java](TypeCasting.java): This file explains type casting in Java

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the `part_01` directory.
3. Compile the Java files using the following command:
   ```sh
   javac *.java
   ```
4. Run any of the compiled programs using the `java` command. For example, to run `Main.java`, use:
   ```sh
   java Main
   ```

## Purpose

The purpose of this part is to provide a foundation for understanding basic Java concepts and syntax. Each file is designed to be a small, self-contained example that illustrates a specific aspect of the Java language.
