# Part 02 - Java Basics Continued

## Overview

This part of the project continues with more fundamental Java concepts. It covers boolean data types, mathematical operations, operators, and special characters in Java.

## Files

1. **[Booleans.java](Booleans.java)**: Introduces the boolean data type and operations.
2. **[Mathematics.java](Mathematics.java)**: Covers basic mathematical operations in Java.
3. **[Operators.java](Operators.java)**: Demonstrates the use of various operators in Java.
4. **[SpecialCharacter.java](SpecialCharacter.java)**: Discusses special characters and escape sequences in Java.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the `part_02` directory.
3. Compile the Java files using the following command:
   ```sh
   javac *.java

Run any of the compiled programs using the java command. For example, to run Booleans.java, use:
```sh
java Booleans
```
## Purpose
The purpose of this part is to further enhance the understanding of basic Java concepts. Each file is designed to be a small, self-contained example that illustrates a specific aspect of the Java language.
